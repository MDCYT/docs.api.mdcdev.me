## Prices

All of our API endpoints are free to use, but we do have some rate limits in place to prevent abuse. If you need more requests per minute, please [contact us](mailto:me@mdcdev.me) and we can discuss a custom plan.

## Why you create this?

I created this API to help developers to create cool stuff with some API's from different services. Like [Discord](https://discord.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [GitHub](https://github.com) and more.

## How to use this API?

You can use this API by making a request to the endpoint you want to use. You can find all the endpoints in the sidebar.

## Still need some help?

Join the [Official Discord Developers server](https://discord.gg/CUCyFmwEmg) for support and discussion.

We can’t wait to see what you make.
